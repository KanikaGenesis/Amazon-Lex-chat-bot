# Amazon Lex Chatbot - BankerBot

## Description

This project demonstrates building a chatbot using Amazon Lex. Named BankerBot, it greets users, handles basic interactions, and manages fallback intents for unrecognized inputs. The project highlights the use of AI/ML for natural language understanding, showcasing setup, intent creation, and custom fallback responses.

## Features
